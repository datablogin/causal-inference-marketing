- `--focus style` - Code style and formatting

### üì§ **Multiple Output Modes**
- **Comment mode** (default): Posts review directly as PR comment

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic review of current PR (posts as comment)

# Review specific PR with security focus
./claude-review.sh --focus security 54

# Save review to file instead of posting

# Draft comment for team review
./claude-review.sh --draft-comment --focus performance 54
```

## Dependencies

- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) - For PR data and posting comments
- **Claude Code** (`claude`) - For AI-powered reviews  
- **jq** - For JSON parsing
- **Git** - For branch management

## File Organization

Reviews are saved to:
```
reviews/manual/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-54-security-20241126_1430.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-55-causal-inference-20241126_1530.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-56-20241126_1630.md
```

## Causal Inference Intelligence

When reviewing causal inference code, the script automatically checks for:

- ‚úÖ Proper `BaseEstimator` inheritance patterns
- ‚úÖ Correct usage of `TreatmentData`/`OutcomeData`/`CovariateData` models  
- ‚úÖ Statistical assumption checking and validation
- ‚úÖ Bootstrap implementation and confidence intervals
- ‚úÖ Treatment of missing data and edge cases
- ‚úÖ Reproducibility through proper random state management

## Output Format

### File Mode
Creates comprehensive markdown files with:
- PR metadata and context
- Complete diff information  
- Review prompt used
- Claude's analysis and feedback
- Token usage estimate

### Comment Mode
Posts structured comments with:
- PR context summary
- Review feedback sections
- Professional formatting for team visibility

## Migration from Original Script

The enhanced script is backward compatible:
- `./claude-review.sh` works exactly like the original
- All new features are opt-in via flags
- Preserves existing file organization

## Integration with Development Workflow

Add to your workflow:
```bash
# Before creating PR
make ci                           # Run tests
./claude-review.sh --dry-run     # Preview review

# After creating PR  
./claude-review.sh --post-comment  # Share with team
```

This enhanced script brings the full power of the GitHub Action to your local development environment!
