# Analysis of "Causal Inference: What If" Python Code for Marketing Applications

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive examination of the `jrfiedler/causal_inference_python_code` repository, I've identified robust, production-ready implementations of core causal inference methods that can be directly adapted for marketing applications. The book code provides solid statistical foundations with clear implementation patterns that align well with our monorepo architecture.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Analysis

### Chapter 11: Standardization (G-computation)
**Statistical Method**: Outcome regression with standardization
**Implementation Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Production ready)

#### Key Components Found:
```python
# Core linear regression implementation
X = np.ones((df.shape[0], 2))
X[:, 1] = df.A
Y = np.array(df.Y).reshape((-1, 1))
theta = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(Y)

# Statsmodels integration for confidence intervals
ols = sm.OLS(Y, df[['constant', 'A']])
res = ols.fit()
pred = res.get_prediction(exog=[1, 90])
```

#### Marketing Applications:
1. **Media Mix Modeling**: Standardization for measuring incremental channel effects
   - Direct application: Replace treatment A with marketing channel exposure
   - Covariates L: Customer demographics, seasonality, competitive activity
   
2. **Campaign Attribution**: Outcome modeling for conversion prediction
   - Treatment: Campaign exposure (binary, continuous, or categorical)
   - Outcome: Conversion, revenue, engagement metrics
   
3. **A/B Testing with Covariates**: Standardized treatment effects
   - Handles imbalanced randomization with covariate adjustment
   - Polynomial models for non-linear dose-response relationships

#### Code Patterns to Port:
- Matrix algebra implementations for fast computation
- Confidence interval calculation using prediction intervals
- Bootstrap methods for robust standard errors
- Quadratic and polynomial feature engineering

### Chapter 12: IP Weighting
**Statistical Method**: Inverse probability weighting with propensity scores
**Implementation Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Production ready with stabilized weights)

#### Key Components Found:
```python
# Logistic regression for propensity scores
def logit_ip_f(outcome, pred, censored):
    # Creates IP weights using logistic regression
    # Handles both binary and continuous treatments
    # Includes stabilized weight calculations
    
# Marginal structural models
# Weighted outcome regression using IP weights
```

#### Marketing Applications:
1. **Incrementality Testing**: Propensity-weighted treatment effects
   - Natural experiments where treatment assignment isn't random
   - Geo-holdout tests with systematic differences between regions
   
2. **Attribution Modeling**: Selection bias correction
   - Customer propensity to be exposed to different channels
   - Correcting for algorithmic bidding biases in paid media
   
3. **Cohort Analysis**: Time-varying treatment effects
   - Customer lifecycle analysis with time-varying interventions
   - Seasonal campaign effects with proper weighting

#### Code Patterns to Port:
- `logit_ip_f()` function for robust propensity score estimation
- Stabilized weight calculations to prevent extreme weights
- Truncation methods for handling positivity violations
- Integration with outcome regression for final estimates

### Chapter 13: Doubly Robust Estimation (AIPW)
**Statistical Method**: Augmented inverse probability weighting
**Implementation Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Most robust approach)

#### Key Components Found:
```python
# Block expansion method for prediction
block2 = nhefs_all[common_Xcols + ['zero', 'zero']]  # All treated
block3 = nhefs_all[common_Xcols + ['one', 'smokeintensity']]  # All untreated

# Bootstrap confidence intervals
boot_samples = []
for _ in range(2000):
    sample = nhefs_all.sample(n=nhefs_all.shape[0], replace=True)
    # ... bootstrap resampling and estimation
```

#### Marketing Applications:
1. **Campaign ROI Measurement**: Double protection against model misspecification
   - Combines propensity modeling with outcome prediction
   - Robust to violations of either modeling assumption
   
2. **Customer Lifetime Value**: Causal impact of touchpoints
   - Treatment: Marketing touchpoint exposure
   - Outcome: Long-term customer value
   - Protection against both selection and outcome model failures
   
3. **Multi-touch Attribution**: Combining channel models
   - Propensity models: Why customers see different channel mixes
   - Outcome models: How channels contribute to conversions
   - Doubly robust combination provides best of both approaches

#### Code Patterns to Port:
- Block expansion method for counterfactual prediction
- Bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals
- Modular design separating propensity and outcome models
- Efficient matrix operations for large datasets

### 2. Multi-treatment Extensions
```python
# Book: Binary treatment (quit smoking: 0/1)
# Marketing: Multi-channel attribution (search, social, display, email, etc.)
# Required: Multinomial propensity models, simultaneous treatment effects
```

### 3. Time-series Components

# Book: Medical outcomes (weight change)
# Marketing: Revenue, ROAS, customer lifetime value
# Required: Business metric transformations, economic significance testing
```
