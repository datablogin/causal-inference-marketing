# Causal Inference for Innovators Tutorial Series

> "They push the human race forward" - This tutorial series embodies the spirit of innovation and challenging conventions in causal inference.

## Overview

This tutorial series is designed for researchers, data scientists, and innovators who want to "think different" about causal inference. Rather than following traditional approaches, these tutorials challenge assumptions and inspire revolutionary thinking about causality.

## Tutorial Topics

### 1. [Breaking the Rules: When Traditional RCTs Aren't Possible](01_breaking_the_rules.ipynb)
Learn to identify causal relationships when randomized controlled trials are impossible, impractical, or unethical. Discover creative approaches to causal inference in the real world.

### 2. [Seeing Different: Identifying Causal Relationships Others Miss](02_seeing_different.ipynb)
Develop the mindset to spot hidden confounders, discover unexpected causal mechanisms, and question conventional wisdom in your field.

### 3. [The Crazy Idea: Using ML for Causal Inference](03_the_crazy_idea.ipynb)
Explore how machine learning can enhance causal inference, from causal forests to deep causal networks. Push beyond traditional statistical methods.

### 4. [Change Things: From Analysis to Intervention](04_change_things.ipynb)
Transform causal insights into actionable interventions. Learn to design effective treatments and policies based on causal understanding.

### 5. [Push Forward: Advancing Beyond Correlation](05_push_forward.ipynb)
Master advanced techniques for establishing causality in complex systems. Challenge the status quo of correlation-based analysis.

### 6. [The Impossible: Causal Inference with Minimal Data](06_the_impossible.ipynb)
Learn techniques for causal inference when data is scarce, messy, or incomplete. Discover methods that work when others fail.

### 7. [Revolutionary Thinking: Creating New Methods](07_revolutionary_thinking.ipynb)
Understand how to develop novel causal inference approaches. Learn from the innovators who changed the field.

## Target Audience

- **Researchers** who want to challenge conventional approaches
- **Data Scientists** ready to question correlation-based analysis
- **Innovators** who believe in pushing boundaries
- **Anyone** who thinks "there must be a better way"

## Philosophy

These tutorials are inspired by the belief that true innovation comes from:
- **Questioning assumptions** others take for granted
- **Seeing possibilities** where others see limitations
- **Creating solutions** when none exist
- **Pushing forward** when others say it's impossible

## Getting Started

Each tutorial is self-contained but builds on concepts from previous ones. Start with Tutorial 1 and work your way through the series. Each includes:

- **Narrative storytelling** with real-world case studies
- **Interactive exercises** to reinforce concepts
- **Code examples** using our causal inference library
- **Challenge problems** to push your thinking
- **Further reading** to deepen understanding

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Our causal inference library
- Jupyter notebook environment
- An open mind and willingness to challenge assumptions

## Contributing

Have ideas for new tutorials or improvements? We welcome contributions that embody the innovative spirit of this series. Think different, challenge assumptions, and help push the field forward.
