    "- Do violent video games cause aggression? (Unethical to expose children)\n",
    "- Does education improve lifetime earnings? (Can't deny education randomly)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Question Everything\n",
    "- **Traditional thinking**: \"We need randomization for causality\"\n",
    "- **Revolutionary thinking**: \"Nature provides experiments everywhere\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Look for Natural Experiments\n",
    "- Geographic boundaries (states, countries)\n",
    "- Arbitrary cutoffs (GPA thresholds, age limits)\n",
    "- Policy changes (laws, regulations)\n",
    "- Random events (lotteries, weather)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploit Institutional Rules\n",
    "- School assignment boundaries\n",
    "- Eligibility thresholds\n",
    "- Bureaucratic procedures\n",
    "- Historical accidents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Think Like a Detective\n",
    "- What creates variation in treatment?\n",
    "- Is this variation \"as good as random\"?\n",
    "- What other factors could explain the outcome?\n",
    "- How can I rule out alternative explanations?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Exercise: Find Your Own Natural Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a causal question in your field where randomization is impossible. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify potential instruments** - What randomly affects your treatment?\n",
    "2. **Look for discontinuities** - Are there arbitrary cutoffs in your domain?\n",
    "3. **Find natural experiments** - What events create random variation?\n",
    "4. **Design your approach** - How would you exploit this variation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples to Inspire You:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marketing**: Store opening decisions based on population thresholds\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Hospital admission cutoffs based on bed availability  \n",
    "- **Education**: Classroom size limits creating random assignment\n",
    "- **Technology**: Server assignments based on user ID ranges\n",
