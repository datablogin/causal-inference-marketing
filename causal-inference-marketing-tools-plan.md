# Causal Inference Tools for Marketing Applications: Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive causal inference platform for marketing applications, building on the theoretical foundation of "Causal Inference: What If" by Hernán and Robins and leveraging the existing Python implementations from the `causal_inference_python_code` repository. The implementation will use a **hybrid approach** that combines the simplicity of a research library with the scalability of an enterprise-grade microservices platform, leveraging the existing `analytics-backend-monorepo` infrastructure.

## Background Analysis

### Source Materials
- **Book**: "Causal Inference: What If" by Miguel A. Hernán and James M. Robins (2020)
- **Code Repository**: `jrfiedler/causal_inference_python_code` (Chapters 11-17 implementations)
- **Data**: NHEFS dataset (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study)

### Key Causal Inference Methods Covered
1. **Standardization and IP Weighting** (Chapters 11-12)
2. **Outcome Regression and Doubly Robust Estimation** (Chapter 13)
3. **G-methods for Time-varying Treatments** (Chapters 14-17)
4. **Instrumental Variables** (Chapter 16)
5. **Causal Survival Analysis** (Chapter 17)

## Marketing-Specific Applications

### Target Use Cases
1. **Campaign Attribution**: Multi-touch attribution modeling with proper causal identification
2. **Incrementality Testing**: Measuring true incremental lift from marketing interventions
3. **Media Mix Modeling**: Causal decomposition of marketing channel effects
4. **Customer Lifetime Value**: Causal impact of marketing touchpoints on CLV
5. **A/B Test Analysis**: Proper analysis of randomized experiments with network effects
6. **Holdout Testing**: Design and analysis of geo-based holdout experiments
7. **Marketing Budget Optimization**: Causal-based allocation recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid Approach: Library + Microservices Platform

The implementation leverages the existing `analytics-backend-monorepo` architecture to provide both a simple research library and an enterprise-grade production platform.

#### Phase 1: Shared Library (Weeks 1-4)
Develop core causal inference functionality as a shared library within the monorepo:

```
shared_libs/
└── causal_inference/
    ├── core/
    │   ├── estimators/          # Core causal inference estimators
    │   ├── identification/      # Causal identification methods
    │   └── validation/         # Model validation and diagnostics
    ├── data/
    │   ├── preprocessing/       # Data preparation utilities
    │   └── simulation/         # Synthetic data generation
    └── utils/                  # Common utilities and helpers
```

#### Phase 2: Marketing Microservices (Weeks 5-12)
Build specialized services using the existing monorepo patterns:

```
services/
├── attribution-service/        # Multi-touch attribution APIs
├── incrementality-service/     # Incrementality testing platform
├── mmm-service/               # Media mix modeling service
├── experiment-service/        # A/B testing and causal analysis
└── reporting-service/         # Visualization and dashboards
```

#### Phase 3: Platform Integration (Weeks 13-16)
Leverage existing infrastructure for production deployment:

```
analytics-backend-monorepo/
├── shared_libs/
│   ├── causal_inference/      # Core causal methods (NEW)
│   ├── common/               # Existing shared utilities
│   ├── database/             # Database abstractions
│   ├── messaging/            # Event handling
│   └── monitoring/           # Observability
├── services/
│   ├── attribution-service/   # NEW marketing services
│   ├── incrementality-service/
│   ├── mmm-service/

3. **Port first estimator**: Implement G-computation from source repository
4. **Integration testing**: Ensure new library works with existing monorepo infrastructure

This hybrid approach leverages your existing investment in enterprise-grade infrastructure while providing the focused causal inference capabilities needed for marketing applications. The result will be a unique competitive advantage - a production-ready causal inference platform rather than just another academic library.
