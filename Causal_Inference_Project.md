The book "Causal Inference: What If" by Hernán and Robins is an excellent resource for your use case—analyzing observational marketing data (e.g., customer behavior, sales outcomes) for hints of causality from interventions like promotions, campaigns, and loyalty programs. Since you're dealing with historical data only (no randomized experiments), the focus should be on methods from Parts I and II for identifying and estimating average causal effects under assumptions like exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding), positivity, and consistency. These can help adjust for confounders (e.g., regional differences, customer demographics) and selection biases (e.g., self-selection into loyalty programs).

Part III's methods for time-varying treatments (e.g., repeated promotions over time) could also apply if your data has longitudinal elements, like customer interactions across multiple periods.

Below, I'll recommend key methods from the book to implement in software, prioritized by relevance to your scenario (regional/grouped data, campaigns, loyalty programs). These are observational analogs to experiments, aiming to emulate a "target trial" (Chapter 22). I'll explain why each is useful, key assumptions, and high-level implementation notes (using Python via the code\_execution tool, leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and scipy). Focus on building modular functions (e.g., for propensity scoring, IP weighting) that can chain together.

### 1\. **Propensity Score Methods (Chapter 15: Outcome Regression and Propensity Scores)**

- **Why implement?** Propensity scores (PS) estimate the probability of treatment (e.g., exposure to a regional campaign or loyalty program) given confounders (e.g., store location, past purchases). They're great for your grouped data—loyalty programs create "treated" vs. "control" groups, but with confounding (e.g., self-selection). PS can balance groups via matching, stratification, or weighting, hinting at causal effects on outcomes like sales uplift.  
- **Key assumptions:** Exchangeability (PS captures all confounders), positivity (every confounder combination has some treated/untreated units), no measurement error in confounders.  
- **Implementation ideas:**  
  - Fit a logistic regression (statsmodels) to predict treatment (binary: exposed to promo \=1/0) from confounders.  
  - Use PS for: (a) Matching (pair treated/untreated with similar PS), (b) Stratification (group by PS quantiles), (c) Weighting (inverse PS for average treatment effect in the treated/untreated).  
  - Output: Causal risk difference/ratio/odds ratio.  
  - Code sketch: Use pandas for data handling; statsmodels.Logit for PS model; implement matching with scipy's KDTree for nearest neighbors.  
  - Extensions: Combine with outcome regression for doubly robust estimation (Section 15.5).

### 2\. **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Marginal Structural Models (Chapter 12: IP Weighting and Marginal Structural Models)**

- **Why implement?** IPW creates a "pseudo-population" where treatment (e.g., national vs. regional campaigns) is balanced across confounders, mimicking randomization. Useful for your regional data—weight stores/customers to estimate effects of promotions on aggregated outcomes (e.g., average sales). Marginal structural models (MSMs) extend this to model dose-response (e.g., promo intensity) or effect modification (e.g., by loyalty group).  
- **Key assumptions:** Same as PS (exchangeability, positivity), plus correct model specification for weights.  
- **Implementation ideas:**  
  - Compute stabilized weights: sw \= Pr(A) / Pr(A | confounders), where A is treatment.  
  - Fit weighted regression (statsmodels.WLS) for MSM: E\[Y^a\] \= β0 \+ β1 a (linear for mean; logistic for binary outcomes).  
  - Handle time-varying exposures (e.g., sequential campaigns) with product of time-specific weights (Section 12.6 for censoring/missing data).  
  - Output: Average causal effect (e.g., risk difference).  
  - Code sketch: Use numpy for weight calculation; pandas for data prep; bootstrap (scipy) for variance. Stabilize weights to avoid extremes (Section 12.3).

### 3\. **Standardization and the Parametric G-Formula (Chapter 13: Standardization and the Parametric G-Formula)**

- **Why implement?** Standardization estimates counterfactual outcomes (e.g., "what if all stores got the loyalty promo?") by averaging over confounder distributions. The g-formula simulates interventions, ideal for your scenario to compare "what if" scenarios like national campaigns vs. baseline. It's nonparametric in spirit but parametric in practice, handling effect modification (e.g., by region).  
- **Key assumptions:** Exchangeability, positivity, consistency; correct outcome model.  
- **Implementation ideas:**  
  - Fit an outcome model (e.g., statsmodels.OLS/GLM) regressing Y (e.g., sales) on A and confounders.  
  - Standardize: Predict Y under A=1 and A=0 for all units, then average (Section 13.3).  
  - Parametric g-formula: Iterate predictions for time-varying data (e.g., multi-period promos).  
  - Output: Standardized means/risks; causal contrasts.  
  - Code sketch: Use pandas for simulation (copy dataset, set A=1/0, predict); sympy/mpmath for any symbolic math if needed. Compare IPW vs. standardization (Section 13.4).

### 4\. **Instrumental Variable (IV) Estimation (Chapter 16: Instrumental Variable Estimation)**

- **Why implement?** If you can find a valid IV (e.g., regional policy variations as an "instrument" for promo exposure, assuming it affects treatment but not outcomes directly), this handles unmeasured confounding—common in marketing data (e.g., unobserved customer preferences). Useful for loyalty programs if assignment is quasi-random (e.g., based on store region).  
- **Key assumptions:** Relevance (IV affects treatment), exclusion (IV affects outcome only via treatment), exchangeability (IV independent of unmeasured confounders), monotonicity/homogeneity (Sections 16.3-16.4).  
- **Implementation ideas:**  
  - Two-stage least squares (statsmodels.IV2SLS): Stage 1 predicts treatment from IV; Stage 2 regresses outcome on predicted treatment.  
  - Estimate local average treatment effect (Section 16.2) for "compliers" (e.g., regions responsive to campaigns).  
  - Bounds if assumptions weak (Section 16.2).  
  - Output: IV estimand (e.g., risk difference in compliers).  
  - Code sketch: Use statsmodels for 2SLS; test IV strength (F-stat \>10 for relevance).

### 5\. **Target Trial Emulation (Chapter 22: Target Trial Emulation)**

- **Why implement?** This frames your observational data as emulating a hypothetical RCT (e.g., "what if we randomized promos by loyalty group?"). It's a unifying approach: Define a target trial protocol (eligibility, treatment strategies, outcomes), then use methods like IPW or g-formula on your data. Handles your regional/loyalty groupings and time aspects (e.g., sustained promos).  
- **Key assumptions:** Those of the estimation method (e.g., IPW); well-defined interventions (Section 22.2).  
- **Implementation ideas:**  
  - Workflow: Specify trial components (time zero \= promo start; per-protocol effect \= sustained exposure).  
  - Emulate with cloning/censoring/weighting for adherence (Section 22.3).  
  - Integrate with IPW/g-formula for estimation.  
  - Output: Intention-to-treat/per-protocol effects.  
  - Code sketch: Pandas for data simulation (cloning cohorts); chain with IPW functions.

### Additional Methods to Consider (If Data is Longitudinal/Time-Varying)

If promotions repeat over time (e.g., weekly campaigns), implement from Part III:

- **G-Methods for Time-Varying Treatments (Chapter 21\)**: Extend IPW/MSM/g-formula for sequential exposures (e.g., dynamic strategies like "promo if low sales last period"). Handles treatment-confounder feedback (Chapter 20).  
- **G-Estimation of Structural Nested Models (Chapter 14, extended in 21\)**: For additive effects in time-varying settings; less sensitive to model misspecification.

### General Implementation Advice

- **Software Structure:** Build a Python library with classes/functions for each method (e.g., PropensityScorer, IPWEStimator). Input: Pandas DataFrame with columns for treatment (A), outcome (Y), confounders (L), regions/groups. Output: Effect estimates, confidence intervals (via bootstrapping or robust variance).  
- **Handle Biases (Part I: Chapters 6-9):** Always start with DAGs (networkx for visualization) to identify confounders/colliders. Implement checks for selection bias (e.g., IPW for missing data) and measurement bias.  
- **Variable Selection & Machine Learning (Chapter 18):** Use lasso/ridge (PuLP/statsmodels) or ML (torch for neural nets) for high-dimensional confounders; doubly robust estimators to guard against misspecification.  
- **Validation:** Simulate data (numpy.random) mimicking your setup; test methods. Use sensitivity analysis (e.g., for unmeasured confounding, Section 7.5).  
- **Limitations:** These give "hints" of causality but rely on strong assumptions (e.g., no unmeasured confounding). Document them in your tool's output.  
- **Why these?** They're core to observational causal inference, directly applicable to marketing (e.g., A/B-like from loyalty groups), and computationally feasible with your tools. Skip survival analysis (Chapter 17\) unless outcomes involve time-to-event (e.g., time to purchase).

# Analysis Instructions:

As a senior marketing analytics manager with over 15 years of experience in leveraging observational data for causal insights in retail and consumer goods, I'm excited to guide this set of analyses on our promotional and loyalty program data. Our goal is to use causal inference methods to estimate the effects of different promotions (regional campaigns, national campaigns, and loyalty-specific materials) on key outcomes like sales uplift, customer engagement, or purchase frequency. Since we have historical regional/store-level data with confounders (e.g., store traffic, seasonality, customer demographics proxies), we'll emulate target trials where possible to hint at causality.

This plan is structured for data scientists and engineers testing our new causal inference product. Each analysis step includes:

- **Objective**: What we're estimating and why.  
- **Method**: Specific causal technique from the toolkit (drawing from propensity scores, IPW, standardization, IV, etc.), with key assumptions.  
- **Process**: Step-by-step instructions for implementation, including data prep, modeling, and validation.  
- **Expectations**: Desired outputs, metrics, and how they'll inform the next step or final decision. Include sensitivity checks for assumptions (e.g., no unmeasured confounding via exchangeability tests).  
- **Timeline & Resources**: Rough estimate for testing.

The analyses build sequentially: Start with descriptives for baseline, move to adjusted effects, then simulate interventions. Ultimate synthesis: Recommend the next promotion (e.g., scale national campaigns with loyalty integration) and budget allocation (e.g., $X million based on estimated ROI from uplift \* scale \- costs).

Assume the data is in a DataFrame-like structure (e.g., columns: store\_id, region, loyalty\_group \[0=none, 1=program1, 2=program2\], promo\_type \[0=none, 1=regional, 2=national\], sales\_outcome, confounders \[traffic, season, etc.\]). Use Python with statsmodels, sklearn, etc., for implementation. Validate with bootstrapping for CIs and DAG visualizations for confounding.

### Analysis 1: Data Preparation and Descriptive/Associational Analysis

**Objective**: Establish baseline metrics and crude associations to identify potential confounders and effect directions before causal adjustments. This spots biases like selection into loyalty programs.

**Method**: Standard descriptives \+ stratified associations (no causal adjustment yet). Assumptions: Data completeness; no major measurement error.

**Process**:

1. Load and clean data: Handle missing values (impute or flag), create binary indicators (e.g., any\_promo \= 1 if promo\_type \> 0), categorize variables.  
2. Compute summaries: Means/SDs for sales by promo\_type, loyalty\_group, region. Cross-tabs for treatment distribution.  
3. Associational tests: ANOVA/chi-square for sales \~ promo\_type; regressions like OLS sales \~ promo\_type \+ loyalty\_group (unadjusted).  
4. Visualize: Boxplots of sales by groups; correlation heatmap for confounders.  
5. Export: Summary tables and plots.

**Expectations**: Outputs include mean sales (e.g., \~808 overall, higher for national promo \+ loyalty2). Identify imbalances (e.g., loyalty groups more exposed to promos). This baselines crude effects (e.g., national promo assoc. \+130 sales) to compare with causal estimates. Flag potential confounders (e.g., traffic correlates with promo assignment). If imbalances are severe, proceed to PS/IPW. Timeline: 1 day; 1 engineer.

### Analysis 2: Propensity Score Matching for Effect of Loyalty Programs on Promo Response

**Objective**: Estimate the causal effect of loyalty program enrollment (treatment: loyalty\_group \>0 vs. 0\) on sales uplift under promotions, adjusting for self-selection bias.

**Method**: Propensity score (PS) matching (nearest neighbor). Assumptions: Conditional exchangeability (PS captures confounders like region, traffic); positivity; consistency.

**Process**:

1. Define treatment: Binary loyalty\_enrolled \=1 if loyalty\_group \>0.  
2. Fit PS model: Logistic regression Pr(loyalty\_enrolled | region, traffic, season, promo\_type).  
3. Match: Nearest neighbor (caliper=0.1) treated to controls on PS; check balance (std. mean diff \<0.1).  
4. Estimate: Average treatment effect (ATE) as mean(sales\_treated\_matched) \- mean(sales\_control\_matched); bootstrap 1000x for 95% CI.  
5. Subgroup: Stratify by promo\_type for effect modification.  
6. Sensitivity: Test for unmeasured confounding (e.g., Rosenbaum bounds).

**Expectations**: ATE e.g., \+80 sales for enrolled vs. not (CI: 60-100), with better balance post-matching. If effect stronger in program2, prioritize it. Outputs: Matched dataset, balance diagnostics, effect plots. This informs if loyalty amplifies promos. Timeline: 2 days; 1 DS \+ 1 engineer.

### Analysis 3: Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) for Marginal Effects of Promo Types

**Objective**: Estimate average causal effects of promo\_type (0/1/2) on sales, creating a balanced pseudo-population. Great for multi-level treatments.

**Method**: IPW with marginal structural models (MSM). Assumptions: Exchangeability, positivity (check Pr(promo|L) \>0.01), correct weight model.

**Process**:

1. Fit weight model: Multinomial logistic Pr(promo\_type | region, loyalty\_group, traffic, season).  
2. Compute stabilized weights: sw \= Pr(promo\_type) / Pr(promo\_type | confounders); trim extremes (\>99th percentile).  
3. Fit MSM: Weighted OLS sales \~ promo\_1 \+ promo\_2 (dummies), weights=sw.  
4. Estimate: Coefficients as effects (regional vs. none, national vs. none); robust SEs.  
5. Validate: Weight diagnostics (mean\~1, no extremes); effective sample size.

**Expectations**: Effects e.g., regional \+58 (CI: 40-75), national \+130 (CI: 110-150). If national strongest, it's a candidate. Outputs: Weight histograms, MSM summary, counterfactual means. Compare to descriptives for bias reduction. Timeline: 2 days; 1 DS.

### Analysis 4: Standardization and Parametric G-Formula for Counterfactual Scenarios

**Objective**: Simulate "what if" all stores got each promo\_type, standardizing over confounder distribution to predict population-level impacts.

**Method**: Parametric g-formula. Assumptions: Exchangeability, positivity, correct outcome model.

**Process**:

1. Fit outcome model: OLS sales \~ promo\_type \+ region \+ loyalty\_group \+ traffic \+ season \+ interactions (if modification suspected).  
2. Simulate: Copy dataset 3x; set promo\_type=0/1/2; predict sales; average for standardized means.  
3. Estimate: Differences as effects (e.g., mean\_under\_national \- mean\_under\_none).  
4. Bootstrap: 500x for CIs.  
5. Extend to g-formula: If time-series data available, iterate for sustained promos (e.g., 3 periods).

**Expectations**: Standardized effects e.g., regional \+53, national \+96. Predict total uplift (e.g., \+$96K across 1000 stores if $1/sales unit). Outputs: Counterfactual distributions, effect tables. This directly feeds budget (uplift \* scale). Timeline: 1.5 days; 1 DS.

### Analysis 5: Instrumental Variable (IV) Estimation for Robustness to Unmeasured Confounding

**Objective**: Use a quasi-instrument (e.g., region as IV for promo exposure) to estimate local effects, handling hidden biases like unobserved customer preferences.

**Method**: Two-stage least squares (2SLS). Assumptions: Relevance (region affects promo), exclusion, monotonicity.

**Process**:

1. Define IV: Binary high\_promo\_region \=1 if region in high-exposure areas (e.g., 4-5).  
2. Stage 1: OLS any\_promo \~ high\_promo\_region \+ confounders; check F-stat \>10 for strength.  
3. Stage 2: OLS sales \~ predicted\_any\_promo \+ confounders.  
4. Estimate: Coefficient as LATE; Hausman test vs. OLS.  
5. Sensitivity: Bounds if monotonicity violated.

**Expectations**: LATE e.g., \+100 for compliers (regions responsive to promos). If diverges from IPW (e.g., negative due to weak IV), flag for review. Outputs: Stage summaries, F-stat, effect with CI. Use as robustness check. Timeline: 1 day; 1 DS.

### Analysis 6: Doubly Robust Estimation and Target Trial Emulation for Synthesis

**Objective**: Combine methods for robustness; emulate a hypothetical RCT for next promo (e.g., randomize national \+ loyalty2).

**Method**: Doubly robust (DR) estimator (IPW \+ outcome model); target trial framework. Assumptions: At least one model correct.

**Process**:

1. DR: Augment IPW with outcome residuals for ATE.  
2. Emulate trial: Define protocol (eligibility: all stores; treatment: national vs. baseline; time zero: next quarter; outcome: sales at 3 months).  
3. Apply IPW/g-formula: "Clone" cohorts, weight for adherence.  
4. Sensitivity: Vary assumptions (e.g., unmeasured confounder strength).  
5. ROI calc: Uplift \* stores \* margin \- costs (assume $20/store regional, $40 national).

**Expectations**: DR ATE e.g., \+110 for national; per-protocol effect \+120. Simulated ROI e.g., 2.5x for national. Outputs: DR results, emulation report, decision dashboard. Timeline: 2 days; 2 DS.

### Synthesis and Decision

Run analyses in sequence, integrating outputs into a dashboard (e.g., Jupyter). Cross-validate (e.g., PS ATE vs. IPW). If consistent, trust; else, investigate (e.g., positivity violations).

**Final Recommendation**: Based on converged estimates (national promo yields \+100-130 sales uplift, stronger with loyalty2), next promotion: National campaign integrated with loyalty program2 (e.g., targeted materials). Allocate $500K (assuming 1000 stores \* $40/store national \+ $10/store loyalty boost; expected ROI 3x from $3M uplift at $30 margin/sales unit). Monitor with A/B if possible post-launch. If IV suggests null, downscale to $300K pilot in high-response regions.
