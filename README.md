# Causal Inference Tools for Marketing Applications

A comprehensive Python library for applying causal inference methods to marketing analytics, including attribution modeling, incrementality testing, and media mix modeling.

## Overview

This library provides production-ready implementations of causal inference methods specifically designed for marketing use cases. Built on the theoretical foundation of "Causal Inference: What If" by HernÃ¡n and Robins, it offers both academic rigor and practical applicability for marketing practitioners.

## Key Features

- **Attribution Modeling**: Multi-touch attribution with proper causal identification
- **Incrementality Testing**: Geo-based holdout experiments and difference-in-differences
- **Media Mix Modeling**: Causal decomposition of marketing channel effects
- **Experimental Design**: A/B testing with network effects and interference
- **Customer Analytics**: Causal impact analysis for customer lifetime value
- **Budget Optimization**: Causal-based marketing budget allocation

## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install causal-inference-marketing
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datablogin/causal-inference-marketing.git
cd causal-inference-marketing
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from causal_inference_marketing import Attribution, IncrementalityTest

# Multi-touch attribution analysis
attribution = Attribution(method="doubly_robust")
results = attribution.fit(data, treatment_col="channel", outcome_col="conversion")

# Incrementality testing
increment_test = IncrementalityTest(method="geo_holdout")
lift = increment_test.estimate_lift(data, treatment_periods, control_periods)
```
